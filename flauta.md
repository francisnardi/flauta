We’ve identified that this bug is related to a task previously worked on in earlier sprints, EMISZ-2140.

The Autosys system is currently experiencing an issue that prevents us from easily enabling the calendar for the year 2025. Additionally, based on the FEPWEB team’s experience, we’ve noticed that the maximum calendar activation period is 5 years, but we’re unable to achieve even that at the moment.

As a temporary solution, though not ideal, we propose the following (still to be implemented):

Map out all the first business days of each month in 2025 so we can manually run the job through Autosys (or directly via EMIS) – using EMIS process 5715.
